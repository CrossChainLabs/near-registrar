# Rust

_Using Gitpod? You can skip these setup steps!_

To run this project locally:

1. Prerequisites: Make sure you have Node.js ≥ 12 installed (https://nodejs.org), then use it to install [yarn]: `npm install --global yarn` (or just `npm i -g yarn`)
2. Install dependencies: `yarn install` (or just `yarn`)
3. Follow instructions for installing [rust] here https://docs.near.org/docs/roles/developer/contracts/near-sdk-rs#pre-requisites

Now you can run all the [rust]-related scripts listed in `package.json`! Scripts you might want to start with:

- `yarn test:unit:rs`: Runs all Rust tests in the project
- `yarn build:rs`: Compiles the Rust contracts to [Wasm] binaries


# AssemblyScript

_Using Gitpod? You can skip these setup steps!_

To run this project locally:

1. Prerequisites: Make sure you have Node.js ≥ 12 installed (https://nodejs.org), then use it to install [yarn]: `npm install --global yarn` (or just `npm i -g yarn`)
2. Install dependencies: `yarn install` (or just `yarn`)

Now you can run all the [AssemblyScript]-related scripts listed in `package.json`! Scripts you might want to start with:

- `yarn test:unit:as`: Runs all AssemblyScript tests with filenames ending in
  `unit.spec`
- `yarn build:as`: Compiles the AssemblyScript contracts to [Wasm] binaries
